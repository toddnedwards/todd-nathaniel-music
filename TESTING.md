### Axe Dev Tools

I used axe dev tools to see if further errors we're found on my pages.

- Index Page
I found on the index page that there was an error for sufficient contrast ratio. I fixed this by changing all text in the "why book me?" section from white to black. 
I also found that my headers we're not in order for using h1, h2, h3 etc, so I changed the header title to H1 and the about me section to h2. This fixed the problems and still worked well with the sizings for the page so no further styling elements we're needed.

No other errors we're found on other pages.

## Manual Testing

### Testing User Stories

The most common path to navigate through the website is:
Home > Setlist > Media > Tour > Contact

These are the order they are placed in the navigation bar and are accessible from each page.

Each page is important to a potential client booking the musician as they need to know about the musician from the home page, what songs they play from the setlist, want to see and hear the artist from the media page. If they like this information but would like to see a performance, they may look at tour dates to come and see the artist. If they they want to directly enquire after that or simply message instead with an enquiry they can go straight to contact page. 

#### Testing client stories from UX section of README.md

##### Client Goals

1. To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.

Each page has breakpoints set up for client visibility to be optimised. I used bootstrap columns too for breakpoints to make information clearer. I also hid the image in the "why book me?" section on the index page as this was unneccessary for phone and tablet screens and took up more space, taking attention away from further information that the client needs to know.
I used bootstrap also for the navigation bar on smaller devices to make it more user friendly for smaller devices.

2. To make it clearly visible for potential clients to see and hear the artist.

This is provided by the hero image on the first index page, seeing and image of the artist. The media page also provides a video and 4 images of the artist so clients can see them.

3. To make it easy for potential clients to contact the artist directly for booking enquiries.

This is provided by the contact page, where they can leave their details for booking enquiries. There is also a phone number and email address set up on the contact page if they prefer that contact method. On each page, social media links are provided in the footer section if clients would like to find out further information and make contact with the artist through social media as well.

4. To allow people to see reviews of the artist so they can see past feedback to help with their decision of possible booking the artist for their own event.

Reviews are provided on the index.html page underneath the "why book me?" section, titled "reviews". These also use bootstrap to collapse into one row when on smaller devices to make all text clear to read for the client.

5. To allow people to visit social media pages also from the site with icons.

Social media links are provided on the footer section of every page. They also utilise the '_blank' element to open the social media link in a new page to not take the attention away from the website.

##### First Time Visitor Goals

1. To find out who Todd Nathaniel is and what they do as a musician.

This information is provided on index.html with a hero image to show what Todd Nathaniel looks like, followed by an about me section with a short description. This is then followed with "why book me" to provide information on what clients can expect, and reviews so clients can see what other clients have said about the artist to get a clearer idea of their performances.

2. To navigate easily through the site with simple laid out titles.

These are provided in the navigation section clearly. In mobile view these become a hamburger style dropdown menu which is expected of most websites on mobile devices to make it clearer for users.

3. Be able to find social media links.

All social media links are provided in the footer section.

4. Be able to message the artist directly to book or see a phone number provided to call.

A contact form is provided on the contact.html page, as well as a phone number and email address to contact.

##### Returning Visitor Goals

1. Be able to see up to date performance dates as they are announced.

Tour dates are provided on the tour.html page as well as hyperlinks provided to events where tickets can be bought externally.

2. Be able to contact the artist easily.

Contact form, phone number and email address provided on the contact.html page as well as social media links in footer section.

3. Be able to see new content via gallery and media.

All content is provided in this section, including 4 images and 1 promotional video.

##### Frequent Visitor Goals

1. Be able to see new songs being uploaded and new performance dates added.

New songs, videos and images can be uploaded directly to the media.html section in the future.
